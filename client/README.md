##Notes
- I created this project to demonstrate that I could create UI side components using Reactjs stack
- I have written a few test cases to showcase how Jest and Enzyme can be used to test React based application
- Few more test cases can be written to cover aspects like integration test etc
- I have not written comments in the code because I feel the code should be readable, should not need comments to understand it.
